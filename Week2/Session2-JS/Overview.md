# Javascript and DOM Manipulation

## Intoduction
    - What is JS and why do we use it? 
    - Completes the trifecta for front end development
    - console.log() One of the most important built in javascript functions you will ever learn. 
    - Brief review on syntax

## Variables
    - var
    - identifier
    - equality set ( = )
    - value (reference to the identifier)

** Whatdo we putin variables? **

## Primitive Data Types

    - Strings
    - Number or Integers
    - Boolean

** How can we interact with variables?

## Operators

    - + (Can be used to add numbers mathematically or combine strings)
    - -
    - /
    - *
    - = (Assigns)
    - == (checks equality between 2 variables)
    - ! (the NOT operator - flips the comparison - != is NOT EQUAL TO)

## Operator shortcuts -> (Extra)
    - ++ -> a++ is short for a = a+1
    - -- -> a-- is short for a = a-1
    - -= -> a-=b is short for a = a-b
    - += -> a+=b is short for a = a+b



## Strings

    - Makeup
    - String concatenation
    - String interpolation

## Numbers
    - Can have arithmetic functions run on them
    - Can be decimals as well

## Booleans
    - true 
    - false


## Functions
    - function name () { Body }
    - calling/invoking functions -> name()
    - arguments -> Placeholder variables for data passd into the function
    - Parameters -> Used to assign value to the arguments

# DOM Manipulation
    - What is it?
    - Attaching script to your html
    - html events
    - the 'this' keyword
    - document.querySelector()
    - Calling functions from the html
    - Putting it all together
        - onclick
        - onchange
        - onmouseover
        - onmouseout

    ** Warning: There is a css selector for when you hover over objects. Do not use this on the exam. I will have to take off points. **
